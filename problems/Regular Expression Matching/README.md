# Problem

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for `.` and `*` where:

- `.` Matches any single character.
- `*` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

# Input Format

The first string in which the program will try to find the pattern

The second string will be the pattern

# Output Format

The output will be a boolean, indicating whether the regular expression was successful or not
